# Webshop Application

A simple **e-commerce web application** built entirely with **Node.js and Express**.

The webshop allows users to:
- View products  
- Add and remove items from the shopping cart  
- Apply discount codes  
- Manage wallet balance  
- Complete purchases  

This project was developed for educational purposes to demonstrate **basic e-commerce flows** and **manual testing** in a web-based application.
